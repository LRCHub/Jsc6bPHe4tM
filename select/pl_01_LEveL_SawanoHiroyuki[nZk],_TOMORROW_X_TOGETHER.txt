罠だらけの理想　慰めの口実
Gonna say I told you so
取り上げられる希望
Short cut to be a star
Wasn’t born to raise the bar
誤魔化しの正義は
誰も起こせないアラームのようだ
Failing feeling
喜怒哀楽をクリーンにしないで
声をFreeに
Let’s get ‘em
So givin’ yourself
Ya givin’ yourself
The best shot
Be givin’ yourself
Ya givin’ yourself
The best shot
Don’t you gotta get solo?
What you gonna get?
Swear it!
Don’t you dare forget Solo
Ya give it your best shot!
Go reach out to get ya…
Gotta
Go reach out to get ya…
Just
Go reach out to get ya…
Get up, reach out for it
Go reach out to get ya…
Gotta
Go reach out to get ya…
Just
Go reach out to get ya…
Just get in, get out,
get on to it
Can’t remember to forget
Little boy who lost the bet
Now I’m racking up the kills
I got to pay the bills
The bills
Be grateful
What you get
is a way to hit reset
Give you more than just a leg
Off the hook
I’m god level
Failing feeling
All those days are dead
There’s no railing, ceiling
Let’s get ‘em
So givin’ yourself
Ya givin’ yourself
The best shot
Be givin’ yourself
Ya givin’ yourself
The best shot
Don’t you gotta get solo?
What you gonna get?
Swear it!
Don’t you dare forget Solo
Ya give it your best shot!
Go reach out to get ya…
Gotta
Go reach out to get ya…
Just
Go reach out to get ya…
Get up, reach out for it
Go reach out to get ya…
Gotta
Go reach out to get ya…
Just
Go reach out to get ya…
Just get in, get out,
get on to it
Game over but they
gave him all the cheat codes
Little kiddy in the gutter with
the bloody nose
On the cover but he doesn’t
even read those
The headlines
The headlines
So jacked but
he hasn’t got an ego
Local boy and he
came up from a zero
Every battle we can watch him
as the power grows
And grows
Let’s get ‘em
So givin’ yourself
Ya givin’ yourself
The best shot
Be givin’ yourself
Ya givin’ yourself
The best shot
Don’t you gotta get solo?
What you gonna get?
Swear it!
Don’t you dare forget Solo
Ya give it your best shot!
Go reach out to get ya…
Gotta
Go reach out to get ya…
Just
Go reach out to get ya…
Get up, reach out for it
Go reach out to get ya…
Gotta
Go reach out to get ya…
Just
Go reach out to get ya…
Just get in, get out,
get on to it
